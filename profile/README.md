### Hi there! :wave:

We're Rubberdøk, a team of students at NTNU Trondheim. Some of the things we do:

- Maintain [indokntnu.no](https://indokntnu.no), a website for students at Industrial Economics and Technology Management ([`rubberdok/indok-web`](https://github.com/rubberdok/indok-web))
  - The project is fully open-source — [see how you can contribute today](https://github.com/rubberdok/indok-web/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
- Teach web development to curious students ([`rubberdok/webdev-demo`](https://github.com/rubberdok/webdev-demo))
